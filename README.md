## Product Vision Statement

### Overview
Our vision is to develop ecoReport, a decentralized, community-driven weather reporting system that provides reliable and hyper-local environmental data in the absence of centralized federal resources. ecoReport empowers individuals to contribute observations from personal instruments, ensuring that accurate, real-time weather information remains accessible to the public.

### Motivations
ecoReport addresses the urgent need for dependable weather data when centralized systems are unavailable due to budgetary or infrastructural constraints. By crowdsourcing observations from citizens, the platform not only ensures continuity of essential information but also fosters community engagement, transparency, and trust. Hyper-local contributions provide finer granularity than traditional systems, creating a richer and more responsive picture of local weather conditions.

### User Focus
ecoReport is designed for simplicity and accessibility. Community members can input conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind, or precipitation using personal thermometers, hygrometers, or digital sensors. Reports are geotagged (via GPS or manual entry), validated, and aggregated into consensus-based forecasts. In return, users gain access to both raw and community-synthesized data, empowering them to make informed decisions about daily activities and safety.

### Business and Community Goals
The success of ecoReport is measured by its ability to:  
- Sustain public access to accurate weather data regardless of federal cuts.  
- Build a robust, engaged user base within the first six months.  
- Provide hyper-local insights to municipalities, schools, and individuals who rely on timely weather information
The platform will be mobile-first, scalable, and optimized for rapid updates so that contributions immediately enrich the dataset.

### Compliance and Accessibility
ecoReport is committed to protecting user privacy and data integrity. Only essential location data is captured, and reports are anonymized to prevent misuse. The platform adheres to international data protection standards (e.g., GDPR, COPPA) and follows accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1.), ensuring inclusive participation across communities.


### Security
Data integrity and user safety are central to ecoReportâ€™s design. Validation mechanisms prevent false or malicious submissions, encryption safeguards reports in transit, and regularaudits ensure system resilience. Security practices are embedded throughout development and operations to maintain reliability and community trust.

### Conclusions
ecoReport envisions a future where communities independently sustain reliable weather reporting through collective participation. By uniting transparency, accessibility, and security in a user-friendly system, ecoReport ensures that the loss of centralized weather infrastructure does not compromise public access to critical environmental information

## User Requirements  

1. As a new user, I want to create an account and log in so that my reports and history are saved.  
2. As a community member, I want to submit local weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, precipitation) so that I can contribute to the dataset.  
3. As a contributor, I want to geotag my submission automatically or manually so that my report is tied to the correct location.  
4. As a user, I want to view aggregated local conditions so that I can see real-time weather in my area.  
5. As a traveler, I want to search conditions in a specific location so that I can prepare before leaving home.  
6. As a user, I want to filter reports by temperature, precipitation, or air quality so that I can focus on what matters to me.  
7. As a user, I want to receive alerts when severe conditions are reported nearby so that I can stay safe.  
8. As a community member, I want to see visualizations (maps, charts, trends) so that I can understand conditions at a glance.  
9. As a privacy-conscious user, I want my reports to be anonymized so that my identity is protected.  
10. As an admin, I want to flag and remove false or malicious submissions so that the dataset stays trustworthy.  
11. As an admin, I want to audit reports periodically so that the system remains resilient and accurate.
